          <p>
            This finance tracker is unique as it runs in the terminal with a
            terminal user interface (TUI). It was made using{" "}
            <strong>Golang</strong> and the{" "}
            <a href="https://github.com/rivo/tview/">tview</a> package, with a{" "}
            <strong>sqlite database</strong> backend. Features include recording
            income, expenditure and investments, custom categories, displaying
            investment returns with data from Yahoo Finance, and dashboard
            summaries. All CRUD database operations are supported, and it is
            navigable using Vim keybindings. <br></br>
            <br></br>
            This project originated from me not wanting to open Google Sheets to
            track my finances, alongside wanting the power of SQL to investigate
            where my money is going. Apparently others have had the same wish as{" "}
            <strong>
              the project gained several stars on{" "}
              <a href="https://github.com/shen-kit/finance-tracker-tui">
                GitHub
              </a>
            </strong>
            , with users requesting features such as custom scripting
            capabilities and configuration files. Although the project is still
            in its early days, I hope to turn it into a community project in the
            future.

          <p>
            I created my own high-level, statically and strongly typed, compiled
            programming language using <strong>Haskell</strong>. It compiles to{" "}
            <strong>LLVM IR</strong> (a processor-independent intermediate
            representation), then uses <tt>llc</tt> and <tt>gcc</tt> to link to
            the standard C libraries and generate machine code. Functionality
            includes integers/strings/booleans, conditionals (if/else if/else,
            while loops), boolean logic and integer arithmetic, print
            statements, and variables for all data types.

            Waypoint is a project management tool for teams following the Scrum
            methodology, created with <strong>ReactTS</strong> and{" "}
            <strong>MongoDB</strong>, and containerised with{" "}
            <strong>Docker</strong>. Features include admin and developer
            accounts with JTW authentication, the ability to manage users, the
            product backlog, and multiple sprints, as well as a kanban and list
            view for each sprint the current developer is assigned to.

              Head's Up!
            </a>
            , I created <i>Hia's Up!</i> as a game that we could play at family
            gatherings. The game is like celebrity heads, where the player has
            to guess what is on the screen by asking everyone else questions. If
            they guess it right, they tilt the phone up, and to skip, they tilt
            the phone down. It was made using <strong>Flutter and Dart</strong>{" "}
            (source code available on{" "}

            This was my final project for the CS50 Introduction to Computer
            Science course, written in <strong>HTML, CSS and Javascript</strong>
            , and using the <strong>Electron</strong> framework. Features
            include a daily planner with tasks and events, a monthly calendar,
            and a habit tracker which integrates with the calendar. This project
            taught me web-development skills, how to use npm, how to write
            responsive apps, and the importance of creating a thorough plan
            before starting to code. The source code is available on{" "}

        <p className={classes.lastParagraph}>
          I've made several password managers over the years, the most recent
          one in 2023 in <strong>Python</strong> using the Cryptography library
          for security. I decided to make it to learn the{" "}
          <strong>basics of cryptography</strong> and to refresh my knowledge of
          databases (I used <strong>sqlite</strong>). Additionally, I enjoy
          working in the terminal so didn't want a GUI password manager.
          Functionality includes setting a master password which is then
          encrypted, adding/editing/deleting new services, listing all stored
          services, and resetting the database. While this wasn't very
          challenging to build, it is the project which I use the most in my
          daily life.

          for this website was written myself. The source code can be found on{" "}
