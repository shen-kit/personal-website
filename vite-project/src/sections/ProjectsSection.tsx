            they guess it right, they tilt the phone up, and to skip, they tilt
            the phone down. It was made using <strong>Flutter and Dart</strong>{" "}

            I've made several password managers over the years, the most recent
            one in 2023 in <strong>Python</strong> using the Cryptography
            library for security. I decided to make it to learn the{" "}
            <strong>basics of cryptography</strong> and to refresh my knowledge
            of databases (I used <strong>sqlite</strong>). Additionally, I enjoy
            working in the terminal so didn't want a GUI password manager.
            Functionality includes setting a master password which is then
            encrypted, adding/editing/deleting new services, listing all stored
            services, and resetting the database. While this wasn't very
            challenging to build, it is the project which I use the most in my
            daily life.
